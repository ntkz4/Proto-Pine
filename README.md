# Proto-Pine
prototype of a game i tried to code using what i learned from various sources; both traditionally and ai assisted

# What game are you making?

- the game that im making is called VOID//. original, i know but it does sound cool and niche

## Why are you doing this?
- with the world nowadays having a heavy reliance on the internet, and the usage of ai is overwhelmed, even in work and school, i thought

> *"hey? why dont i just learn to benefit from them, instead of just using ai to get my work done?"* 

- another reason is that because i have always been in love in developing and coding a game. i got inspired by a game called intravenous, which is a 2d tactical top-down stealth shooter(long i know)
- i also want to learn coding, and to build my portforlio as a coder.

## "You're using AI to learn coding? Thats not fair."
- as i said, rather than using it for just rushing and getting a task done, i want to also benefit from them by learning to code, and importantly, get good in **MATH**

## For this project, what engine are you using? And can you explain in details why you chose it?
- for this project, i chosed LOVE2D as the engine, instead of Gamemaker, Godot, Roblox Studio, and even Scratch.
- my reasoning for choosing LOVE2D as the engine for my game is that because, just like some popular game and the game that i got inspired of, uses Lua.
- for me, lua is not **HARD** to understand, but outside of that, in Univeristy life, i rarely get to use it. these days, my programming class in Uni uses python.
- furthermore, using LOVE2D means that i can create my own games from scratch. for most game engines, like gamemakers, and godot, i have to figure out which is which, and that can get pretty confusing and frustrating.
  
## What are your goals then? (In life, and for your project.)
- my goal in life is to make something like a program or product that will leave my legacy behind.
  # **ill try to achieve high grades, socialize, and try to learn from my mistakes, even if it means getting out of my shell.**
- my goal for this project is to become popular, hoping that one day it can be served as a memory, and a good, honest portfolio.

# thats all from me, thank you! made with love.
