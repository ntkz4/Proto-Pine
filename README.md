# Proto-Pine
prototype of a game i tried to code using what i learned from various sources

## a little "why i did this"
with the world nowadays having a heavy reliance on the internet, and the usage of ai is overwhelmed, even in work and school, i thought

> *"hey? why dont i just learn to benefit from them, instead of just using them"* 

i mostly do this "game" dev thing to try and make games too, inspired by games like intravenous 2.
